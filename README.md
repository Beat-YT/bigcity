# BigCity (25 Tiles mod)

This is the GitHub repo for my Cities: Skylines mod.


## Steam

If you have the game on steam, just subscribe to it on the [steam workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=1270675750)

## How to install manually :

If you have the game on another platform (like Epic Games) you can also install the mod manually.

Copy the `BigCity` folder in the `Mods` folder inside of :

- **Windows**: `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Colossal Order\Cities_Skylines\Addons\Mods` (quickly access it by typing `%APPDATA` in Explorer's path then navigating one folder up).
- **Linux**: `/home/<username>/.local/share/Colossal Order/Cities_Skylines/Addons/Mods/`
- **Mac**: `/Users/<username>/Library/Application Support/Colossal Order/Cities_Skylines/Addons/Mods`

The game will then automatically compile and install the mod.
